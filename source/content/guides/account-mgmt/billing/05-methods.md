Self-serve accounts accept credit card payments only. Pantheon does not currently accept alternative methods of payment for online site purchases (e.g., checks, PayPal, etc.).

<Alert title="Note" type="info" >

Payment for a site can't be split among payment methods. This means that your payment can only come from one card at a time.

</Alert>

Payment methods can be added in either your Personal Settings, or in a Site Dashboard.

To add a payment method via Personal Settings:

1. [Go to your Personal Workspace](/guides/account-mgmt/workspace-sites-teams/workspaces#switch-between-workspaces), click **Settings**, then select **Payment Methods**.

1. Enter the card information, then click **Add New Card**.  The card will appear in the list, and will be available as a selection for any site you own.
